## How to contribute

### Structure of SwiftInspector

SwiftInspector is divided into two main parts:

#### SwiftInspector

Contains the main executable for this command line tool. It contains the entry point `main.swift` file.


#### SwiftInspectorKit

Itâ€™s divided into **Frontend** and **Core**.

- **Frontend**: The scaffolding around managing commands and options for these commands. This is what the end user interacts with.
- **Core**: In here is where the magic happens. Any file that's related to analyzing Swift code should go in here.


### Adding a new Command

To add a new command create a `YourCommand.swift` file inside the `Frontent/Commands` folder in `SwiftInspectorKiit`. Your command should delegate to files under `Core/` for all the logic related to analyzing Swift code.
